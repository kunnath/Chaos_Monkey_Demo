## API Endpoints

The demo application provides several endpoints for testing:

- `GET /` - Home page
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/data` - Sample data retrieval
- `GET /api/slow` - Slow processing endpoint (2-5s)
- `GET /api/memory-intensive` - Memory-heavy operations
- `GET /api/cpu-intensive` - CPU-heavy computations
- `GET /api/database` - Database simulation
- `GET /stats` - Application statistics

## Configuration

### Chaos Experiments

You can customize chaos experiments by modifying the `create_sample_experiments()` function in `chaos_monkey.py`:

```python
ChaosExperiment(
    name="Custom CPU Test",
    chaos_type=ChaosType.CPU_STRESS,
    duration=15,  # seconds
    probability=0.3,  # 30% chance
    parameters={"cores": 4}
)
```

### Load Testing

Adjust load testing parameters in `load_tester.py`:

```python
tester.start_load_test(
    requests_per_second=5.0,  # Requests per second
    duration=300,             # Test duration in seconds
    num_threads=6            # Number of concurrent threads
)
```

### Monitoring

Configure monitoring intervals in `system_monitor.py`:

```python
monitor.start_monitoring(interval=5)  # Check every 5 seconds
```

## Safety Considerations

This demo is designed to be safe for development and testing environments:

- **Resource Limits**: Chaos experiments use controlled resource consumption
- **Temporary Effects**: All chaos effects are temporary and self-cleaning
- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative default parameters prevent system damage
- **Easy Termination**: Ctrl+C stops all components gracefully

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Do not run this on production systems without proper safeguards and approval.

## Educational Use Cases

### Learning Chaos Engineering
- Understand how applications respond to failures
- Learn to identify system bottlenecks
- Practice incident response procedures
- Develop resilience testing strategies

### Testing Scenarios
- **Service Discovery**: How does your system handle service outages?
- **Resource Constraints**: What happens under CPU/memory pressure?
- **Network Issues**: How resilient is your application to connectivity problems?
- **Recovery Patterns**: How quickly does your system recover from failures?

## Extending the Demo

### Adding New Chaos Experiments

1. Define a new `ChaosType` in the enum
2. Implement the experiment logic in `ChaosMonkey` class
3. Add it to the experiment list

Example:
```python
class ChaosType(Enum):
    CUSTOM_FAILURE = "custom_failure"

def _custom_failure(self, experiment: ChaosExperiment):
    """Your custom chaos experiment"""
    self.logger.info("üî• Running custom failure scenario")
    # Your implementation here
```

### Creating Custom Applications

Replace `demo_app.py` with your own application and use the same monitoring and chaos testing infrastructure.

### Advanced Monitoring

Extend `system_monitor.py` to include:
- Custom application metrics
- External service health checks
- Database performance monitoring
- Custom alert rules

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Check if port 8080 is available (or 5000 if you're using the original port)
- On macOS: Disable AirPlay Receiver in System Preferences ‚Üí General ‚Üí AirDrop & Handoff
- Verify Python environment is activated
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Chaos Monkey Not Working
- Verify the application is running and accessible
- Check for permission issues (especially on macOS/Linux)
- Review chaos_monkey.log for error messages

### High Resource Usage
- Reduce chaos experiment frequency
- Lower the intensity of resource-intensive experiments
- Decrease load testing parameters

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
